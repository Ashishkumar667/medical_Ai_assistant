However, some stings can be painful and trigger a serious allergic reaction. Salient features  Skin around the bite becomes red, swollen and itchy."

This can be painful and itchy for a few days, but is harmless in most cases. They can usually be treated at home.  The severity of bites and stings varies depending on the type of insect and sensitivity of the person. In rare cases, some people can have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a bite or sting that requires immediate medical treatment. Emergency Conditions 79 Non pharmacological treatment  Remove a sting- by scraping it out with fingernails."

Different surgical scrubs available for skin preparation before surgical procedure include any of the following: Povidone-iodine: It acts by oxidation/substitution of free iodine. Povidone iodine is used as a surgical scrub after combining with detergent. It is effective against gram positive bacteria but weaker against other microorganisms. It has a residual activity and is active in presence of organic substance. It is absorbed through skin. It can be used on mucus membranes. Patient skin sensitivity is occasionally a problem."
